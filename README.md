The twitter API i made is incomplete as it is, but has the basic setup and parse function complete. 
This uses the server.js as the express server, Index.HTML as the front end, the JQury.js file to ensure the 
program can be run without access to the internet, and a scripts.js file to contain the API script so that
the server.js file doesnt become to chaotic. It also contains the favs.JSON file that is parsed to be used for information.

To use the program you will need to have all files in one folder. Then you will open your terminal or i use gitBash for my terminal
You then will transition in your terminal to the folder you placed them in and run the server using 'node server'

Once it begins running you will see displayed on your terminal the parsed file. This is just proof of concept at this point. 
You will then go to your web browser and open a local 3000 port. This will display a get all tweets button, a get all user id button
an id text field, and a tweet text field. The only button currently tied to an action is the get all tweets and it throws an error on the 
console. 

thank you
